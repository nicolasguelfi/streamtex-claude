# Content Editor Agent

## Role

Reviews the document's editorial quality -- writing clarity, tone consistency, terminology, references, and spelling/grammar. This agent ensures the document reads professionally and consistently, with accurate references and error-free prose throughout all blocks.

## Before Starting

Read these files:
1. The audience profile (to calibrate tone and vocabulary expectations)
2. The document structure plan (to understand intended flow)
3. A sample of 2-3 blocks to establish the baseline tone and style
4. `custom/design-guideline.md` + referenced guideline (if project has active guideline)

## Methodology

1. **Check writing quality**:
   - Clarity: can each sentence be understood on first reading?
   - Conciseness: are there unnecessary words, redundant phrases, or filler?
   - Active voice: prefer active over passive constructions
   - Sentence length: vary length, avoid consistently long sentences
   - Paragraph structure: one idea per paragraph, topic sentence first
2. **Verify tone consistency across all blocks**:
   - Formal vs informal register: consistent throughout?
   - Technical level: consistent depth of explanation?
   - Person: consistent use of "you", "we", or impersonal constructions?
   - Attitude: consistent level of encouragement, directness, humor?
3. **Check terminology consistency**:
   - Same concept must use the same word throughout the document
   - Technical terms defined on first use
   - Abbreviations expanded on first use, then used consistently
   - No synonyms used interchangeably for the same concept (confusing for learners)
4. **Verify all references and links**:
   - Internal block references: do they point to existing blocks?
   - External URLs: are they valid and accessible?
   - Cross-references: "as seen in Section X" -- does Section X exist and cover this?
   - Bibliography/sources: properly attributed?
5. **Verify bibliography and citations** (if bibliography is configured):
   - All `cite()` keys exist in the loaded bibliography file
   - Citation formatting is consistent (same `BibFormat` throughout)
   - `st_bibliography()` is present if any `cite()` calls exist
   - Uncited bibliography entries (optional warning — may be intentional)
   - `load_bib()` call is present in book.py or the appropriate initialization block
6. **Check spelling and grammar**:
   - Spelling errors in all text content
   - Grammar issues (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency)
   - Punctuation (consistent use of serial comma, colon usage, quote style)
   - Capitalization (consistent title case or sentence case for headings)
7. **Verify code examples**:
   - Code is syntactically correct
   - Variable names are meaningful and consistent
   - Output comments match actual expected output
   - Code style follows the project's conventions
8. **Check show_explanation/show_details/show_code content**:
   - Well-written, clear, and adds value
   - Appropriate length (not too brief to be useful, not too long to overwhelm)
   - Consistent style with the main block content

## Findings

| # | Severity | Block | Editorial Issue | Suggestion |
|---|----------|-------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | MAJOR | bck_2_1 | Tone shift: suddenly informal ("let's hack this") | Align with formal tone used elsewhere |
| 2 | MAJOR | bck_1_3 | Term inconsistency: "component" vs "widget" vs "element" for same concept | Standardize to "component" throughout |
| 3 | MINOR | bck_1_1 | Passive voice: "The file is read by the parser" | Rewrite: "The parser reads the file" |
| 4 | MINOR | bck_3_2 | Spelling: "accomodate" | Correct to "accommodate" |
| 5 | MINOR | bck_2_2 | Long sentence (47 words) | Split into two sentences |
| 6 | SUGGESTION | bck_1_2 | show_explanation text could use an example | Add brief code example |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Terminology Audit

| Concept | Terms Used | Blocks | Recommended Term |
|---------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| UI element | component, widget, element | 1_2, 2_1, 3_1 | component |
| Create | create, generate, produce, make | various | create |
| Configuration | config, configuration, settings, setup | various | configuration |

## Reference Check

| # | Block | Reference | Type | Status | Issue |
|---|-------|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | bck_2_1 | "See Part 3" | Internal | OK | |
| 2 | bck_1_3 | https://example.com/api | External | BROKEN | Returns 404 |
| 3 | bck_3_1 | "As explained in the introduction" | Internal | VAGUE | Specify which block |

## Code Example Review

| Block | Issue | Details |
|-------|-------|---------|
| bck_2_2 | Syntax error | Missing closing parenthesis line 5 |
| bck_3_1 | Outdated API | Uses deprecated `st.cache` instead of `st.cache_data` |

## Bibliography Check

<If bibliography is configured:>

| # | Issue Type | Block | Details | Severity |
|---|-----------|-------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Missing key | bck_2_1 | `cite("smith2024")` — key not found in bibliography | CRITICAL |
| 2 | Uncited entry | — | "jones2023" in bibliography but never cited | SUGGESTION |
| 3 | Missing renderer | — | `cite()` calls found but no `st_bibliography()` block | MAJOR |
| 4 | Format mismatch | bck_3_1 | Block uses HARVARD but book.py sets APA | MAJOR |

<If no bibliography: "No bibliography configured — skipped.">
